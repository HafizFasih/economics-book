# Demand and Supply

## Law of Demand

**Definition**: Price of a product is inversely related to the quantity demanded, holding the effect of other factors constant (*ceteris paribus*).

### Key Points

* **Inverse relationship**: Price ↑ → Quantity Demanded ↓
* When price ↑ → quantity demanded ↓ (except for special cases)
* Price and quantity demanded move in **opposite directions**
* Effect on quantity demanded = **change in price** (movement along the demand curve)

### Demand Curve

* **Downward sloping** (negative slope)
* **Linear Demand Curve**: Straight line with negative slope
* **Demand Function**: Demand = f(Price, Price of Substitutes, Price of Complements, Expectations, Income, Population)
  * Price of product (negative relationship)
  * Price of substitutes (positive relationship)
  * Price of complements (negative relationship)
  * Expectations regarding future
  * Income (normal goods: positive; inferior goods: negative)
  * Population: Larger population → higher demand

### Movement Along Demand Curve

* **Change in Price** → Movement along the same curve
* Price ↑ → Move up the curve (quantity ↓)
* Price ↓ → Move down the curve (quantity ↑)
* **Law of demand is valid**

### Shift in Demand Curve

**Causes** (when other factors change besides price):

1. **Change in Expectations**: Future price expectations
2. **Income Change**:
   * **Normal goods**: Income ↑ → Demand ↑ (positive relationship)
   * **Inferior goods**: Income ↑ → Demand ↓ (negative relationship)
3. **Price of Related Goods**:
   * **Substitutes** (e.g., tea & coffee): Price of Y ↑ → Demand for X ↑
   * **Complements** (e.g., car & petrol): Price of Z ↑ → Demand for X ↓
4. **Taste/Fashion/Trend**: Consumer preferences change
5. **Population**: More people → higher demand

### Special Cases (Non-Linear Demand)

* **Ceteris Paribus** (other factors constant)
* **Demand for Tea**: Function of (Price, Substitutes, Complements, Income, Expectations, Population)

## Law of Supply

**Definition**: Price of a product is directly proportional to the quantity supplied, holding the effect of other factors constant.

### Key Points

* **Direct relationship**: Price ↑ → Quantity Supplied ↑
* When price ↑ → profit increases → supply increases
* **Supply Curve**: Upward sloping (positive slope)
* **Linear Supply Curve**: Straight line with positive slope

### Supply Function

**Supply = f(Price, Technology, Cost of Production, Factor Costs, Tax, Subsidy, Population)**

### Movement Along Supply Curve

* **When Price changes** → Movement along curve
* Other factors constant
* **Law of supply is valid**

### Shift in Supply Curve

**Causes** (when other factors change):

1. **Technology**: Better tech → Supply ↑ (rightward shift)
2. **Cost of Production**: Cost ↓ → Supply ↑
3. **Tax**: Tax ↑ → Supply ↓ (leftward shift)
4. **Subsidy**: Subsidy ↑ → Supply ↑ (rightward shift)
5. **Other factors related to supply**

## Key Relationships

### Substitutes vs. Complements

* **Substitutes** (e.g., Tea & Coffee, Pepsi & Coke)
  * If Price of Coffee ↑ → Demand for Tea ↑
  * Positive relationship: Price of Y ↑ → Demand for X ↑

* **Complements** (e.g., Car & Petrol, Bread & Butter)
  * If Price of Petrol ↑ → Demand for Car ↓
  * Negative relationship: Price of Z ↑ → Demand for X ↓

### Individual vs. Market Demand/Supply

* **Individual Demand & Market Demand**: Horizontal summation of all individual demand curves
  * Market Demand = Individual A Demand + Individual B Demand

* **Individual Supply & Market Supply**: Horizontal summation of all individual supply curves
  * Market Supply = Individual A Supply + Individual B Supply

:::tip Summary
**Demand** and **Supply** are inversely and directly related to price, respectively. Demand curves slope downward, supply curves slope upward. Changes in price cause movements along curves, while changes in other factors cause shifts of the entire curve.

## Self Assessment

### Question 1: True/False with Justification (3 marks)

**Statement:** "If the price of beef increases in Pakistan due to import restrictions, and consequently more consumers switch to chicken, this will cause a rightward shift in the demand curve for chicken."

**Your Answer:** True / False (Circle one)

**Justification (2-3 sentences):**

---

### Question 2: Scenario Analysis (10 marks)

**Context:** In early 2024, Punjab's wheat farmers experienced an exceptionally favorable monsoon season, resulting in a bumper crop. At the same time, the government launched a nutrition awareness campaign highlighting the health benefits of whole wheat products, which significantly influenced urban consumer preferences in Lahore and Islamabad.

**a)** Using a well-labeled supply and demand diagram, illustrate the impact of BOTH the bumper wheat harvest and the successful awareness campaign on the wheat market. Clearly show the initial equilibrium (E₀) and the new equilibrium (E₁), marking all shifts in the curves. **(4 marks)**

**b)** Explain what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity of wheat. Will the price definitely increase, definitely decrease, or is the outcome ambiguous? Justify your answer by referencing the relative magnitudes of the supply and demand shifts. **(3 marks)**

**c)** Analyze how this market change would affect TWO of the following stakeholders, explaining the economic reasoning behind each impact: **(3 marks)**
- Flour mill owners in Faisalabad
- Low-income urban households
- Rice farmers in Sindh

**Answer Key:**

**Question 1:**

**Correct Answer:** TRUE

**Justification:** The increase in beef prices makes beef more expensive relative to chicken. Since beef and chicken are substitute goods (consumers can replace one with the other), the higher beef price increases consumers' willingness to buy chicken at every price level. This represents a change in a non-price determinant of demand (price of related goods), which causes the entire demand curve for chicken to shift rightward. This is a shift of the curve, not a movement along it, because the price of chicken itself has not changed.

**Question 2:**

**(a) Diagram Elements Required:**
- Initial curves D₀ and S₀ intersecting at E₀ (P₀, Q₀)
- S₀ shifts RIGHT to S₁ (bumper harvest = increased supply)
- D₀ shifts RIGHT to D₁ (awareness campaign = increased demand)
- New equilibrium E₁ at intersection of S₁ and D₁, showing Q₁ > Q₀
- Properly labeled axes (Price, Quantity), all curves labeled

**(b) Price and Quantity Analysis:**

**Equilibrium Quantity:** Will **definitely increase** (Q₁ > Q₀). Both the rightward shift in supply and demand push quantity upward—these effects reinforce each other.

**Equilibrium Price:** The price change is **ambiguous** and depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts:
- Supply increase puts **downward pressure** on price (more wheat available)
- Demand increase puts **upward pressure** on price (consumers willing to pay more)

**Final outcome:**
- If supply shift > demand shift → Price falls
- If demand shift > supply shift → Price rises
- If shifts are equal → Price remains unchanged

**(c) Stakeholder Impact Analysis (choose TWO):**

**Flour Mill Owners in Faisalabad:**
Benefit from increased wheat availability (Q₁ > Q₀). Greater supply means mills can secure larger volumes of raw material at stable or lower input costs, improving profit margins and allowing increased flour production.

**Low-Income Urban Households:**
Impact is mixed depending on price outcome. If prices fall (supply shift dominates), purchasing power improves and staple food becomes more affordable. If prices rise (demand shift dominates), households face hardship as they spend disproportionate income on food. The price ambiguity creates uncertain welfare effects.

**Rice Farmers in Sindh:**
Face negative consequences. Wheat and rice are substitutes. The wheat market improvement makes wheat more attractive relative to rice, causing demand for rice to shift LEFT. Rice farmers experience falling prices and reduced sales, squeezing revenues.
