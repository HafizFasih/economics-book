# GDP and GNP

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

**Definition**: The **market value** of all **final goods and services** that are yearly produced (produced by the country's GDP) within a **fiscal year**.

### Key Characteristics

* **GDP = GNP - NFRC** + **Net Factor** payments for
* Domestic product within a **fiscal year**
* Market value of all **final deals** and services (that are yearly produced and consumed fully)

### GDP Calculation Approaches

#### 1. Expenditure Approach

**Formula**: $Y = C + I + G + NX$

Where:
* **C** = Consumption (Govt + Net Exports + Investment)
* **I** = Investment
* **G** = Government consumption expenditure (Govt + A + NX)
* **NX** = Net Exports (Exports - Imports)

**Important Notes**:
* Consumption expenditure (Past of the income not saved but consumed)
* Types of Investment: Business Investment, Residential Investment
* Government Expenditure

#### 2. Income Approach

**All the income expended**

Sum of all expenditures within an year:

**Formula Components**:
* Compensation of employees
* Net interest
* Rental income
* Corporate profits
* Proprietors' income
* Indirect taxes less subsidies
* Depreciation
* $Y=$ consumption (Govt + households (C)) + investment + Govt
* $C^g$ = Government expenditure ($G$)

## Gross National Product (GNP)

**Definition**: It is the market value of all **final** Goods and services that are yearly produced for a country) and within a **fiscal year**.

### GDP vs GNP

**Key Distinction**:
* **GDP**: Focuses on production **within the country's borders** (domestic)
* **GNP**: Focuses on production by **country's nationals** (regardless of location)

**Relationship**:
$$GNP = GDP + NFRC$$

Where **NFRC** = Net Factor Income from abroad

**Or**:
$$GDP = GNP - Net\ Factor\ Payments\ for$$

## Calculation Examples

### Using Expenditure Approach

Given data:
* Compensation of employees: Rs. 100 billion
* Net interest: Rs. 20 billion
* Rental income: Rs. 10 billion
* Corporate profits: Rs. 30 billion
* Proprietors' income: Rs. 15 billion
* Indirect taxes less subsidies: Rs. 15 billion
* Depreciation: Rs. 5 billion
* Consumption expenditure by households (C): Rs. 120 billion
* Investment expenditure by businesses (I): Rs. 40 billion
* Government consumption expenditure (G): Rs. 25 billion
* Net exports (Exports - Imports) (NX): Rs. 10 billion

**Expenditure Approach**:
$$GDP = C + I + G + NX$$
$$GDP = 120 + 40 + 25 + 10 = 195$$
(in billions)

**Income Approach**:

GDP = Sum of All Incomes + Depreciation + Indirect Taxes

$$GDP = (100 + 20 + 10 + 30 + 15) + 5 + 15 = 195$$
(in billions)

## Important Concepts

### What Counts in GDP?

**Included**:
* **Final goods and services** only
* Newly produced goods and services
* Market transactions

**Excluded**:
* **Intermediate goods** (to avoid double counting)
* Used/second-hand goods
* Financial transactions (stocks, bonds)
* Transfer payments (social security, welfare)
* Unpublished/informal economy activities

### National Income Identity

The National Income identity to ensure coherence across different methods of GDP calculation:

**Y = C + I + G + NX** (Expenditure approach)

This ensures consistency whether measuring by:
* What is spent (Expenditure)
* What is earned (Income)
* What is produced (Output/Production)

## Uses and Limitations of GDP

### Uses

1. **Measure the size of economy** (big or small economy)
2. **Make government policies** (Government use data to plan budgets)
3. **Comparing income and per capita** helps compare income levels, living standards
4. **Measure if the economy is growing or shrinking**

### Limitations

1. **Illegal / Unrecorded Informal economic activity** All of this does not
count in GDP
2. **Child laborers (unrecorded)**
3. **Household production** not as mandatory received
4. **Environmental Causings**
5. **Leisure hours**
6. **Emotions**
7. **Not published / Business**

:::tip Summary
**GDP** measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a year. **GNP** measures production by a country's nationals regardless of location. Both can be calculated using **Expenditure Approach** (C + I + G + NX) or **Income Approach** (sum of all incomes + depreciation + indirect taxes). GDP is a key indicator of economic performance but has limitations in capturing informal economy, environmental costs, and quality of life.

## Self Assessment

### Question 1: True/False with Justification (2 marks)

**Statement:** When a furniture manufacturer purchases wood from a lumber company, the value of the wood is included in GDP calculations as part of the production process.

**Your Answer:** True / False (Circle one)

**Justification (2-3 sentences):**

### Question 2: Computational Analysis (12 marks)

Consider the hypothetical economy of **Ecoland** for the fiscal year 2024. The following economic data has been collected:

**Expenditure Data:**
- Personal Consumption Expenditure: Rs. 850 billion
- Gross Private Domestic Investment: Rs. 320 billion
- Government Purchases of Goods and Services: Rs. 280 billion
- Exports: Rs. 195 billion
- Imports: Rs. 245 billion

**Income Data:**
- Compensation of Employees (Wages & Salaries): Rs. 720 billion
- Rental Income: Rs. 85 billion
- Interest Income: Rs. 110 billion
- Proprietors' Income: Rs. 95 billion
- Corporate Profits: Rs. 180 billion
- Indirect Business Taxes: Rs. 125 billion
- Depreciation (Capital Consumption Allowance): Rs. 85 billion

**(a) Calculate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Ecoland using:**
   - **(i) The Expenditure Approach** (3 marks)
   - **(ii) The Income Approach** (3 marks)

   Verify that the National Income Identity holds by confirming both methods yield the same GDP value.

**(b) Discuss the uses and limitations of GDP as a measure of economic well-being.** Your answer should include at least three uses and three limitations with brief explanations. **(6 marks)**

**Answer Key:**

**Question 1:**

**Correct Answer:** **FALSE**

**Justification:** The wood purchased by the furniture manufacturer is classified as an **intermediate good** and is NOT counted separately in GDP to avoid double counting. Only the **final value of the furniture** (the finished product sold to consumers) is included in GDP calculations. Including both the wood and the furniture would overstate the actual production value, as the wood's value is already embedded in the final furniture price.

**Question 2:**

**(a) GDP Calculation:**

**(i) Expenditure Approach:**

GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)

GDP = 850 + 320 + 280 + (195 - 245)

GDP = 850 + 320 + 280 - 50

**GDP = Rs. 1,400 billion**

**(ii) Income Approach:**

GDP = Compensation + Rental Income + Interest + Proprietors' Income + Corporate Profits + Indirect Taxes + Depreciation

GDP = 720 + 85 + 110 + 95 + 180 + 125 + 85

**GDP = Rs. 1,400 billion**

**National Income Identity Verification:** Both methods yield identical results (Rs. 1,400 billion), confirming the identity holds. ✓

**(b) Uses and Limitations:**

**USES:**
1. **Measuring Economic Performance:** GDP indicates economic size and growth rate, enabling policymakers to assess expansion or contraction and design evidence-based policies.

2. **International Comparisons:** GDP allows comparison of economic performance between countries, helping allocate international resources and assess development levels.

3. **Guiding Policy Decisions:** Governments and central banks use GDP to formulate monetary and fiscal policies (expansionary during decline, contractionary during rapid growth).

**LIMITATIONS:**
1. **Excludes Non-Market Transactions:** Does not capture unpaid household work, volunteer services, or informal economy—substantial in developing countries like Pakistan.

2. **Ignores Income Distribution:** Measures total output but not how income is distributed; high GDP may coexist with severe inequality.

3. **Environmental Degradation:** Counts production regardless of environmental costs; ignores quality of life factors like health, education, leisure time, and sustainability.
