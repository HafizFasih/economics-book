# What is Economics

## Definition

**Economics** is the study of how economic agents utilize resources efficiently to meet unlimited wants with limited resources (scarcity).

## Core Concept

* **Scarcity**: Limited resources → Need for efficient allocation
* **Economic Agents**: Individuals, consumers, producers, organizations
* **Primary Objective**: Efficient utilization of limited resources (land, labor, capital, organization)

## Two Major Branches

### Microeconomics

* **Focus**: Individual economic agents (consumers & producers)
* **Scope**: Study of how consumers and producers utilize scarce resources efficiently
* **Key Areas**:
  * Consumer behavior
  * Producer decisions
  * Individual market analysis

### Macroeconomics

* **Focus**: The nation as a whole
* **Scope**: Study of how a nation utilizes scarce resources efficiently
* **Key Concepts**:
  * National income (GDP, GNP)
  * Aggregate economic variables
  * Economic policy at national level

## Key Terminology

**Profit** = Total Revenue (TR) - Total Cost (TC)

* **Total Revenue**: Income from sales
* **Total Cost**: All expenses incurred

:::tip Summary
Economics addresses the fundamental problem of **scarcity** by studying efficient resource allocation. Microeconomics examines individual decision-making, while Macroeconomics analyzes nation-level economic behavior.

## Self Assessment

### Multiple Choice Question

**Question 1:** Ayesha runs a small tailoring shop in Karachi. She can either accept a bulk order for school uniforms (requiring 200 hours of work, generating Rs. 80,000 revenue) or accept multiple small orders for wedding outfits (requiring the same 200 hours, generating Rs. 95,000 revenue). She cannot do both due to time constraints. Her fabric and thread costs are Rs. 40,000 for uniforms and Rs. 50,000 for wedding outfits.

From an economic perspective, what is the key insight this scenario illustrates?

A) Economics is about calculating profit by subtracting costs from revenue
B) Economics studies how businesses maximize revenue in competitive markets
C) Economics examines how individuals allocate scarce resources (time) among competing alternatives to achieve objectives
D) Economics focuses on production decisions in the textile industry

**Answer:** C

**Justification:** While Ayesha will naturally calculate profit (uniforms: Rs. 40,000 profit vs. wedding outfits: Rs. 45,000 profit), the fundamental economic principle here is **scarcity and choice**. Ayesha faces the core economic problem: she has a scarce resource (200 hours of time) and must choose between competing uses. Economics is defined as the study of how individuals/producers allocate limited resources among alternatives to achieve their goals. Option A is too narrow (just profit calculation), Option B misses the scarcity element, and Option D focuses on industry rather than the universal economic principle of resource allocation under constraints.

### Short Question (4 marks)

**Question 2:** Pakistan's government must decide how to allocate its annual healthcare budget of Rs. 500 billion. It faces two competing demands: (1) Building 50 new rural health centers in underserved districts, or (2) Purchasing advanced cancer treatment equipment for existing urban hospitals.

**Answer the following:**

a) Explain why this is fundamentally an *economic* problem, not just a political or ethical one. **(2 marks)**

b) Whether the government chooses option 1 or option 2, what would a **microeconomist** versus a **macroeconomist** focus on when analyzing this decision? **(2 marks)**

---

**Answer Key:**

**Question 2:**

**(a)** This is an economic problem because it involves **scarcity and choice**. The government has a limited healthcare budget (Rs. 500 billion - the scarce resource) and must allocate it among competing alternatives that both address legitimate needs. Economics studies precisely this: how agents (in this case, the government) make decisions about allocating finite resources when faced with unlimited wants/needs. The scarcity forces a trade-off - choosing one option means forgoing the other.

**(b)**
- **Microeconomist focus:** Would analyze the decision at the individual/unit level - examining how specific health centers or hospitals (individual economic agents) respond to the allocation, patient behavior changes in rural vs. urban areas, cost-benefit analysis for individual facilities, and resource allocation efficiency within particular healthcare units.

- **Macroeconomist focus:** Would analyze the aggregate/economy-wide effects - how the decision impacts overall national health outcomes, effects on Pakistan's GDP through workforce productivity, aggregate healthcare spending patterns across the economy, and broader implications for economic growth and development indicators.
