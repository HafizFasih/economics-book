# Elasticity of Demand and Supply

## Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

**Definition**: Responsiveness of one variable onto another. In economics, responsiveness of quantity demanded onto another variable (highly responsive → Elastic, less responsive → Inelastic).

### Formula

**PED = (Percent Change in Quantity Demanded) / (Percent Change in Price)**

### Classification

**Based on absolute value** (ignore negative sign):

1. **Elastic Demand**: $|E_d^p| > 1$
   * Percent change in Qd > Percent change in Px
   * Quantity changes MORE than price changes
   * Long-run, elastic demand

2. **Inelastic Demand**: $|E_d^p| < 1$
   * Percent change in Qd < Percent change in Px
   * Quantity changes LESS than price changes
   * Short-run, inelastic demand

3. **Unit Elastic**: $|E_d^p| = 1$
   * Percent change in Qd = Percent change in Px
   * Perfectly equal responsiveness

4. **Perfectly Elastic**: $|E_d^p| = \infty$
   * Horizontal demand curve
   * Any price increase → Quantity demanded drops to zero

5. **Perfectly Inelastic**: $|E_d^p| = 0$
   * Vertical demand curve
   * No matter how much the price changes, quantity demanded remains the same
   * Does NOT exist in reality

### Elasticity and Total Revenue

**For Elastic Demand** (PED > 1):
* If demand is **elastic**, producer should work on **quantity** rather than **price**
* The change in price makes a **huge change** in quantity demanded
* Price ↑ → TR ↓ (Revenue decreases)
* Price ↓ → TR ↑ (Revenue increases)

**For Inelastic Demand** (PED < 1):
* If demand is **inelastic**, producer should work on **demand price** (price setter)
* The change in demand is less than change in price
* Price ↑ → TR ↑ (Revenue increases)
* Price ↓ → TR ↓ (Revenue decreases)

**Relationship**:
* **Elastic demand** → Producer should work on **quantity** (maximize sales volume)
* **Inelastic demand** → Producer should work on **price** (increase prices to maximize revenue)

## Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)

**Definition**: It measures how much and how quickly the quantity supplied of a good changes when its price changes.

### Formula

**PES = (Percent Change in Quantity Supplied) / (Percent Change in Price)**

### Classification

1. **Elastic Supply**: $PES > 1$ → Percent change in Qs > Percent change in Px
2. **Inelastic Supply**: $PES < 1$ → Percent change in Qs < Percent change in Px
3. **Unit Elastic Supply**: $PES = 1$ → Percent change in Qs = Percent change in Px
4. **Perfectly Elastic Supply**: $PES = \infty$ (horizontal supply curve)
5. **Perfectly Inelastic Supply**: $PES = 0$ (vertical supply curve)

## Income Elasticity of Demand

**Definition**: Responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in income.

### Formula

**Income Elasticity = (Percent Change in Quantity Demanded) / (Percent Change in Income)**

Where M = Income

### Classification

**Based on sign and magnitude**:

1. **Normal Goods**: Income Elasticity > 0 (positive)
   * Income ↑ → Demand ↑
   * **Necessity goods**: 0 < Income Elasticity < 1 (inelastic)
   * **Luxury goods**: Income Elasticity > 1 (elastic)

2. **Inferior Goods**: Income Elasticity < 0 (negative)
   * Income ↑ → Demand ↓
   * Examples: Low-quality products, generic brands

## Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

**Definition**: Responsiveness of quantity demanded of one good to changes in the price of another related good.

### Formula

**Cross-Price Elasticity = (Percent Change in Quantity of X) / (Percent Change in Price of Y)**

### Classification

1. **Substitute Goods**: Cross-Price Elasticity > 0 (positive)
   * Price of Y ↑ → Demand for X ↑
   * Example: Tea and Coffee

2. **Complementary Goods**: Cross-Price Elasticity < 0 (negative)
   * Price of Y ↑ → Demand for X ↓
   * Example: Car and Petrol

3. **Unrelated Goods**: Cross-Price Elasticity = 0
   * No relationship between the goods

## Factors Affecting Elasticity

### Factors Affecting PED:

1. **Availability of Substitutes**: More substitutes → More elastic
2. **Necessity vs. Luxury**: Necessities → Inelastic; Luxuries → Elastic
3. **Time Period**: Short run → Inelastic; Long run → Elastic
4. **Proportion of Income**: Large expense → More elastic
5. **Nature of Product**: Addictive goods → Inelastic

### Factors Affecting PES:

1. **Time Period**: Short run → Inelastic; Long run → Elastic
2. **Availability of Resources**: Easy to obtain → More elastic
3. **Storage Capacity**: Easy to store → More elastic
4. **Production Flexibility**: Easy to switch production → More elastic

:::tip Summary
**Elasticity** measures responsiveness. **PED** shows how quantity demanded responds to price changes; **PES** shows supply responsiveness. Elastic demand ($|E| > 1$) means quantity changes more than price; inelastic ($|E| < 1$) means quantity changes less. Understanding elasticity helps businesses make pricing and production decisions.

### Question 2: Computational Analysis (12 marks)

A mobile phone retailer in Karachi collected the following data for Commodity X (a popular smartphone model) over six months:

| Price (Rs.) | Quantity Demanded (units per month) |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 45,000      | 200                                 |
| 40,000      | 280                                 |
| 35,000      | 360                                 |
| 30,000      | 440                                 |
| 25,000      | 520                                 |
| 20,000      | 600                                 |

**Part (a):** Calculate the price elasticity of demand (PED) when price decreases from Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 35,000. Show your complete working using the midpoint formula and interpret whether demand is elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic at this price range. **(4 marks)**

**Part (b):** Draw the demand curve for Commodity X using the data provided. On your graph:
- Clearly label the axes with appropriate scales
- Mark and identify the **elastic region** (upper portion)
- Mark and identify the **inelastic region** (lower portion)
- Indicate the approximate point of unit elasticity **(4 marks)**

**Part (c):** The retailer is currently selling at Rs. 30,000 per unit and is considering two strategies:
1. Reduce price to Rs. 25,000 to boost sales volume
2. Increase price to Rs. 35,000 to improve profit margins

Based on your elasticity calculations and understanding of the PED-revenue relationship:
- Calculate the total revenue at Rs. 30,000, Rs. 25,000, and Rs. 35,000
- Which strategy should the retailer adopt to maximize total revenue?
- Provide economic reasoning using elasticity concepts to justify your recommendation. **(4 marks)**

**Answer Key:**

**Question 1:**

**Correct Answer:** **FALSE**

**Justification:** Demand is price **inelastic**, not elastic. When price increased by 20 percent, total revenue also increased from Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 43,200. This positive relationship between price and total revenue is the characteristic signature of inelastic demand. If demand were elastic, the revenue would have decreased when price increased, as the percentage drop in quantity would exceed the percentage rise in price.

**Question 2:**

**Part (a):**

**Step 1: Identify values**
- P₁ = Rs. 40,000, Q₁ = 280 units
- P₂ = Rs. 35,000, Q₂ = 360 units

**Step 2: Calculate changes**
- ΔQ = 360 - 280 = 80 units
- ΔP = 35,000 - 40,000 = -5,000 Rs.

**Step 3: Calculate averages**
- Average Q = (280 + 360) ÷ 2 = 320 units
- Average P = (40,000 + 35,000) ÷ 2 = 37,500 Rs.

**Step 4: Apply formula**

PED = (80/320) ÷ (-5,000/37,500) = 0.25 ÷ (-0.1333) = **-1.875**

**Interpretation:** |PED| = 1.875 > 1, therefore demand is **price elastic** in this price range. A 1 percent decrease in price leads to a 1.875 percent increase in quantity demanded.

**Part (b):**

Graph should show:
- Downward sloping demand curve connecting all points
- Elastic region marked in upper portion (Rs. 35,000-45,000)
- Inelastic region marked in lower portion (Rs. 20,000-30,000)
- Unit elasticity point indicated around Rs. 30,000
- Properly labeled axes (Price vs. Quantity)

**Part (c):**

**Total Revenue Calculations:**
- At Rs. 30,000: TR = 30,000 × 440 = **Rs. 13,200,000**
- At Rs. 25,000: TR = 25,000 × 520 = **Rs. 13,000,000** (↓ Rs. 200,000)
- At Rs. 35,000: TR = 35,000 × 360 = **Rs. 12,600,000** (↓ Rs. 600,000)

**Recommendation:** The retailer should **maintain the current price of Rs. 30,000**.

**Economic Reasoning:** The current price is approximately at the **unit elastic point**, which is the revenue-maximizing position. Moving to Rs. 25,000 (inelastic region) reduces revenue because demand is inelastic—price decrease doesn't generate enough quantity increase to compensate. Moving to Rs. 35,000 (elastic region) also reduces revenue because demand is elastic—price increase causes proportionally larger quantity decrease. At unit elasticity, TR is maximized.
