# Market Equilibrium

## Definition

**Market Equilibrium** occurs when demand equals supply: $Q_d = Q_s$

* Equilibrium condition: $Q^d = Q^s$
* At equilibrium: **Demand = Supply**
* **Equilibrium Price (P*)**: The price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied
* **Equilibrium Quantity (Q*)**: The quantity exchanged at equilibrium

## Characteristics of Equilibrium

* **Supply = Demand** at equilibrium point
* **If supply increased**, the condition is called **excess supply** (surplus)
  * In economics → **Surplus**
  * $Q_s > Q_d$ → Demand increased, condition is called **excess demand**
* **Shortage** / **In Economics** → Shortage

## Market Conditions

### Excess Supply (Surplus)

* **Condition**: $Q_s > Q_d$ at current price
* **Situation**: Supply exceeds demand
* **Price Level**: Current price is **above** equilibrium ($P > P*$)
* **Market Response**:
  * Suppliers have unsold inventory
  * Price will **reduce/decrease** to clear surplus
  * Market moves toward equilibrium
* **To manage excess supply**: Price will reduce

### Excess Demand (Shortage)

* **Condition**: $Q_d > Q_s$ at current price
* **Situation**: Demand exceeds supply
* **Price Level**: Current price is **below** equilibrium ($P < P*$)
* **Market Response**:
  * Consumers cannot buy desired quantity
  * Result in **sale** (sellers can raise prices)
  * Price will **increase** due to low price
  * To manage excess demand: Price will increase

## Restoring Equilibrium

### If equilibrium is disturbed, it will eventually restore

* **Increased supply** due to high price → result in less demand. **Therefore** to manage the excess supply, the price will **reduce**
* **Increase demand** due to low price → result in sale
* To manage the supply, price will **increase**

## Shifts and New Equilibrium

### Tax Effect (Subsidy & Tax)

**Effect of Subsidy**:
1. $S_1$ → Price constant, Supply ↑, Demand constant
2. $P_1$ ↓ & Demand ↑
3. $S_2$ & Demand same
4. **Supply ↑, Price ↓**
5. Equilibrium ↑
6. Demand same, Supply ↑, Price ↓

**Tax Effect**:
* When price of product increases, the profit increase resulting in the increase of supply
* Price ($P_x$) ↑ → **Supply Curve** (Movement along same curve)
* When ($P_x$) & (other factors) → shift of supply curve

**If tax is increased**:
* Demand ↑ → Price ↑, Supply ↑
* Demand ↑ → Price ↑, Supply ↑ (constant)
* **Equilibrium** (2½) Demand same, Supply ↑, Price ↓

## Graphical Analysis

**Equilibrium shown graphically**:
* **Point of intersection** of demand and supply curves
* At $E_0$: $P = P_0$, $Q = Q_0$
* If $P > P*$ → Excess Supply → Price falls
* If $P < P*$ → Excess Demand → Price rises
* Market forces push toward equilibrium

:::tip Summary
**Market Equilibrium** is the state where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. Market forces (price adjustments) automatically move the market toward equilibrium when disturbed. **Excess supply** causes prices to fall; **excess demand** causes prices to rise.

## Self Assessment

### Question 1: True/False with Justification (3 marks)

**Statement:** When the government imposes a price ceiling below the equilibrium price in the wheat market, it will result in excess demand, causing consumers to benefit while producers face losses.

**Your Answer:** True / False (Circle one)

**Justification (2-3 sentences):**

### Question 2: Scenario-Based Application (10 marks)

The Pakistani government, concerned about rising transportation costs affecting the common citizen, announces a subsidy of Rs. 50 per liter on petrol. Before the subsidy, the equilibrium price was Rs. 280 per liter, and the equilibrium quantity was 100 million liters per month in the Karachi market.

**a)** Explain how this subsidy will affect the market equilibrium for petrol in Karachi. In your explanation, identify which curve(s) will shift and in which direction. **(3 marks)**

**b)** Draw a well-labeled supply and demand diagram showing the market equilibrium before and after the subsidy. Clearly mark the original equilibrium (E₁), the new equilibrium (E₂), and indicate the amount of the subsidy on your diagram. **(4 marks)**

**c)** Analyze the impact of this subsidy on THREE different stakeholders: (i) consumers, (ii) petrol station owners, and (iii) the government. Consider both benefits and costs in your analysis. **(3 marks)**

**Answer Key:**

**Question 1:**

**Correct Answer:** TRUE

**Justification:** A price ceiling set below equilibrium creates a shortage (excess demand) because the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at the artificially low price. While consumers who successfully purchase wheat benefit from lower prices, producers suffer from reduced revenue and profitability due to selling at below-market prices. However, not all consumers benefit equally—those unable to obtain wheat due to the shortage may resort to black markets or remain unsatisfied.

**Question 2:**

**(a)** The Rs. 50 per liter subsidy will shift the supply curve to the right (downward). This occurs because the subsidy reduces the cost of production for suppliers, making them willing to supply more at every price level. The new market equilibrium will feature a lower price paid by consumers and a higher quantity of petrol traded. The demand curve remains unchanged as consumer preferences and incomes have not been affected.

**(b) Diagram Elements Required:**
- Two supply curves (S₁ and S₂) with S₂ to the right of S₁
- One demand curve (D) sloping downward
- Original equilibrium E₁ at intersection of S₁ and D (Rs. 280, 100 million liters)
- New equilibrium E₂ at intersection of S₂ and D (lower price, ~120 million liters)
- Vertical distance between supply curves labeled as "Rs. 50 subsidy"
- Properly labeled axes (Price, Quantity)

**(c) Stakeholder Impact Analysis:**

**(i) Consumers:** Benefit from lower petrol prices (approximately Rs. 230-250 instead of Rs. 280), reducing transportation and household fuel costs. Can purchase more petrol at the lower price. However, as taxpayers, they indirectly bear the cost of financing the subsidy.

**(ii) Petrol Station Owners:** Benefit by receiving payment from both consumers and government subsidy (total ~Rs. 280-300 per liter), while selling a higher quantity (120 vs. 100 million liters). This increases total revenue and profitability.

**(iii) Government:** Faces substantial financial costs of Rs. 50 × 120 million = Rs. 6 billion per month. Creates fiscal pressure requiring reduced spending elsewhere or increased taxes. Benefit is political goodwill and potential economic stimulation, but opportunity cost is high (funds could go to healthcare, education, infrastructure).
